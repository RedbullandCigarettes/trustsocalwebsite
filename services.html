<h2 class="section-title">A Continuum of Care Tailored to Your Needs</h2>
<p class="section-subtitle">Recovery isn't one-size-fits-all. Our comprehensive treatment programs are designed to meet you wherever you are in your journey—whether you're taking the first step toward sobriety or rebuilding your life after treatment.</p>
</div>
<div style="max-width: 900px; margin: 0 auto; line-height: 1.8; color: var(--gray-700); font-size: 17px;">
<p style="margin-bottom: 25px;">
                    At Trust SoCal, we understand that effective addiction treatment requires more than just abstinence—it demands comprehensive healing of mind, body, and spirit. That's why we've developed a full continuum of care that addresses every aspect of addiction and recovery, from the physical challenges of withdrawal to the emotional work of rebuilding your life.
                </p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 25px;">
                    Our treatment philosophy is built on three foundational pillars: medical excellence, evidence-based therapy, and holistic wellness. We combine the latest advances in addiction medicine with proven therapeutic approaches and complementary healing modalities to create a treatment experience that's as effective as it is transformative. Every member of our clinical team—from our board-certified physicians to our licensed therapists and wellness coordinators—brings years of specialized experience in addiction treatment.
                </p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 25px;">
                    Every treatment plan at Trust SoCal is customized to your unique needs, circumstances, and goals. Our clinical team conducts comprehensive assessments to understand your addiction history, co-occurring mental health conditions, medical needs, and personal strengths. This individualized approach ensures you receive exactly the right level of care at exactly the right time, with the flexibility to adjust your treatment as your needs evolve.
                </p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 25px;">
                    Whether you need medically supervised detox, intensive residential treatment, flexible outpatient support, or long-term continuing care, our programs provide the structure, support, and clinical expertise necessary for lasting recovery. We also understand that addiction affects the whole family, which is why family therapy and education are integrated throughout all our programs.
                </p>
<p>
                    What sets Trust SoCal apart is our unwavering commitment to treating every client with dignity, compassion, and respect. We create a safe, supportive environment where you can focus entirely on healing without judgment or stigma. Our luxury facilities, gourmet dining, and resort-style amenities aren't just perks—they're essential components of creating an environment where genuine transformation can occur.

</div>
<div style="padding: 25px 30px;">
<p style="margin: 0; line-height: 1.7; color: var(--gray-700);">It depends on the substance and how recently you used.
