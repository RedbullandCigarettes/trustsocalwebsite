<p class="hero-description">
                        At Trust SoCal, we believe that addiction affects not just the individual, but the entire family system. 
                        Our evidence-based, family-centered approach addresses the root causes of addiction while healing relationships 
                        and building a strong foundation for lasting recovery.

<h3>Family-Centered Healing</h3>
<p>
                            We recognize that addiction impacts entire family systems. Our approach involves family members 
                            in the treatment process, addressing relationship dynamics and communication patterns that may 
                            contribute to or result from addiction.

<h3>Evidence-Based Treatment</h3>
<p>
                            All our treatment modalities are grounded in scientific research and proven methodologies. 
                            We utilize cognitive-behavioral therapy, dialectical behavior therapy, motivational interviewing, 
                            and other evidence-based approaches tailored to individual needs.

<h3>Holistic Wellness</h3>
<p>
                            Recovery involves healing the whole person - mind, body, and spirit. We integrate traditional 
                            therapy with complementary approaches including mindfulness, nutrition counseling, fitness programs, 
                            and spiritual care when appropriate.

<h3>Individualized Care</h3>
<p>
                            Every person's journey with addiction is unique. We develop personalized treatment plans that 
                            address individual circumstances, co-occurring mental health conditions, trauma history, 
                            and personal goals for recovery.

<p>
                        Research consistently shows that family involvement significantly improves treatment outcomes 
                        and long-term recovery success. At Trust SoCal, we don't just treat the individual - we heal 
                        the entire family system.

<!-- Evidence-Based Modalities Section -->
<section aria-labelledby="modalities-heading">
<h2 id="modalities-heading">Evidence-Based Treatment Modalities</h2>
<div class="modalities-grid">
<div class="modality-card">
<h3>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)</h3>
<p>
                            CBT helps individuals identify and change negative thought patterns and behaviors that contribute 
                            to addiction. This approach is particularly effective for developing coping strategies and 
                            preventing relapse.
                        </p>
</div>
<div class="modality-card">
<h3>Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT)</h3>
<p>
                            DBT focuses on teaching emotional regulation, distress tolerance, interpersonal effectiveness, 
                            and mindfulness skills. It's especially beneficial for individuals with co-occurring mental 
                            health conditions.
                        </p>
</div>
<div class="modality-card">
<h3>Family Systems Therapy</h3>
<p>
                            This approach examines family dynamics, communication patterns, and roles that may contribute 
                            to addiction. It helps families develop healthier ways of relating and supporting recovery.
                        </p>
</div>
<div class="modality-card">
<h3>Motivational Interviewing</h3>
<p>
                            A collaborative approach that helps individuals find their own motivation for change. 
                            This technique is particularly effective in the early stages of treatment when ambivalence 
                            about recovery is common.
                        </p>
</div>
<div class="modality-card">
<h3>Trauma-Informed Care</h3>
<p>
                            Many individuals with addiction have experienced trauma. Our trauma-informed approach ensures 
                            that treatment addresses underlying trauma while maintaining safety and empowerment throughout 
                            the recovery process.
                        </p>
</div>
<div class="modality-card">
<h3>Mindfulness-Based Interventions</h3>
<p>
                            Mindfulness practices help individuals develop awareness of thoughts, feelings, and triggers 
                            without judgment. These skills are invaluable for managing cravings and maintaining long-term 
                            recovery.

                            "Trust SoCal didn't just help my son overcome his addiction - they helped our entire family heal. 
                            The family therapy sessions were challenging but transformative. We learned to communicate again, 
                            to trust again, and to support each other in healthy ways. Two years later, our family is 
                            stronger than ever."

                            "The family-centered approach at Trust SoCal made all the difference. Instead of feeling like 
                            outsiders watching our daughter struggle, we became active participants in her recovery. 
                            The education and support we received helped us understand addiction as a disease and gave 
                            us tools to help rather than enable."
