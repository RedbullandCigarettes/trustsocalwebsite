                                paid my bills, but I was dying inside. The outpatient program at Trust SoCal allowed me to 
                                get treatment while keeping my job. The individual therapy sessions helped me address the 
                                trauma that led to my drinking, and the group sessions showed me I wasn't alone."

                                I lost custody of my two young children, which was my rock bottom. Trust SoCal's

                                biggest motivation for recovery."
