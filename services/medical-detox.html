<h2 style="color: var(--primary-teal); font-size: 32px; margin-bottom: 25px;">What is Medical Detox?</h2>
<p style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.8; margin-bottom: 25px;">
<strong>Medical detox is the first critical step in addiction treatment.</strong> When you've been using drugs or alcohol regularly, your body becomes physically dependent. Stopping suddenly can cause dangerous withdrawal symptoms—that's why medical supervision is essential.
                </p>
<p style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.8; margin-bottom: 25px;">
                    At Trust SoCal's <a href="residential-treatment.html">Orange County detox center</a>, our board-certified physicians and nursing staff provide 24/7 monitoring to keep you safe and comfortable throughout withdrawal. We use FDA-approved medications to ease symptoms and ensure your safety during this challenging transition.

<h3 style="color: var(--primary-teal); margin-bottom: 15px;">Why Medical Detox is Necessary</h3>
<ul style="list-style: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;">
<li style="padding: 8px 0; border-bottom: 1px solid #ddd;">⚠️ <strong>Safety:</strong> Withdrawal from alcohol and benzodiazepines can be life-threatening without medical supervision</li>
<li style="padding: 8px 0; border-bottom: 1px solid #ddd;">💊 <strong>Comfort:</strong> Medications significantly reduce withdrawal symptoms and cravings</li>
<li style="padding: 8px 0; border-bottom: 1px solid #ddd;">🏥 <strong>Medical Monitoring:</strong> 24/7 vital sign checks and immediate intervention if needed</li>
<li style="padding: 8px 0;">📈 <strong>Better Outcomes:</strong> Medically supervised detox dramatically increases treatment completion rates</li>
