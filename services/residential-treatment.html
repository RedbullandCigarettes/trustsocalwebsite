<h2 style="color: var(--primary-teal); font-size: 32px; margin-bottom: 25px;">What is Residential Treatment?</h2>
<p style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.8; margin-bottom: 25px;">
<strong>Residential treatment (also called inpatient rehab) is the gold standard for addiction recovery.</strong> You live at our facility for 30-90 days, receiving intensive therapy and medical support in a structured, drug-free environment away from triggers and daily stressors.
                </p>
<p style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.8; margin-bottom: 25px;">
                    After completing <a href="medical-detox.html">medical detox</a>, residential treatment addresses the psychological, emotional, and behavioral aspects of addiction. Our comprehensive program combines evidence-based therapies, medical monitoring, life skills training, and holistic wellness to give you the tools for lasting sobriety.
                </p>
<div style="background: var(--cream); padding: 25px; border-radius: 12px; margin-bottom: 30px;">
<h3 style="color: var(--primary-teal); margin-bottom: 15px;">Why Residential Treatment Works</h3>
<ul style="list-style: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;">
<li style="padding: 8px 0; border-bottom: 1px solid #ddd;">🏠 <strong>Immersive Environment:</strong> 24/7 focus on recovery without outside distractions or triggers</li>
<li style="padding: 8px 0; border-bottom: 1px solid #ddd;">👥 <strong>Peer Community:</strong> Build connections with others in recovery for mutual support</li>
<li style="padding: 8px 0; border-bottom: 1px solid #ddd;">⚕️ <strong>Medical Support:</strong> On-site medical team for any health concerns or medication management</li>
<li style="padding: 8px 0;">📈 <strong>Higher Success Rates:</strong> Research shows residential treatment has better outcomes than outpatient alone</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h3 style="color: var(--primary-teal); margin-bottom: 15px;">Who Benefits from Residential Treatment?</h3>
<p style="font-size: 17px; line-height: 1.8; margin-bottom: 20px;">

                </p>
<ul style="font-size: 17px; line-height: 2; padding-left: 25px; margin-bottom: 30px;">
<li>Have moderate to severe addiction requiring intensive support</li>
<li>Haven't succeeded with <a href="iop.html">outpatient treatment</a> in the past</li>

<div style="max-width: 800px; margin: 0 auto;">

<h3 style="font-size: 1.1rem; color: var(--teal); margin-bottom: 10px;">How long does residential treatment last?</h3>
<p style="line-height: 1.7; color: var(--gray-600);">Residential treatment at Trust SoCal typically lasts 30-90 days, depending on individual needs. Most patients benefit from 30-45 days for initial stabilization, though longer stays of 60-90 days show significantly higher success rates for lasting recovery, especially for those with co-occurring disorders or long-term addiction.</p>

<h3 style="font-size: 1.1rem; color: var(--teal); margin-bottom: 10px;">What is included in residential treatment?</h3>
<p style="line-height: 1.7; color: var(--gray-600);">Our residential program includes 24/7 medical supervision, individual therapy (3-5 sessions per week), group therapy, medication management, family counseling, holistic therapies like yoga and meditation, nutritious meals, private or semi-private accommodations, and comprehensive aftercare planning to support long-term recovery.</p>

<p style="line-height: 1.7; color: var(--gray-600);">Phone usage policies vary by treatment phase. During the first week, phone access is typically limited to help patients focus on recovery without outside distractions. After initial stabilization, scheduled phone time is allowed to maintain family connections while protecting the therapeutic environment.</p>
