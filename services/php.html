<!-- What is PHP -->

<h2 style="color: var(--primary-teal); font-size: 32px; margin-bottom: 25px;">What is a Partial Hospitalization Program?</h2>
<p style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.8; margin-bottom: 25px;">
<strong>Partial Hospitalization Program (PHP) bridges the gap between inpatient and outpatient care.</strong> You attend intensive treatment 5-7 days per week for 6-8 hours daily, but return home each evening. It's ideal for those stepping down from <a href="residential-treatment.html">residential treatment</a> or who need more structure than standard <a href="iop.html">outpatient care</a>.
                </p>
<p style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.8; margin-bottom: 25px;">
                    Our PHP program provides the clinical intensity of inpatient care with the flexibility to sleep at home, maintain some responsibilities, and practice recovery skills in real-world settings. Many patients combine PHP with <a href="sober-living.html">sober living homes</a> for the best of both worlds.
                </p>
<div style="background: var(--cream); padding: 25px; border-radius: 12px; margin-bottom: 30px;">
<h3 style="color: var(--primary-teal); margin-bottom: 15px;">PHP Program Benefits</h3>
<ul style="list-style: none; padding: 0; margin: 0;">
<li style="padding: 8px 0; border-bottom: 1px solid #ddd;">🏥 <strong>Intensive Treatment:</strong> 30+ hours per week of structured therapy and support</li>
<li style="padding: 8px 0; border-bottom: 1px solid #ddd;">🏠 <strong>Return Home Nightly:</strong> Practice recovery skills in your home environment</li>
<li style="padding: 8px 0; border-bottom: 1px solid #ddd;">👨‍👩‍👧 <strong>Family Involvement:</strong> Easier for family members to participate in therapy</li>
<li style="padding: 8px 0;">💰 <strong>Cost-Effective:</strong> More affordable than residential while maintaining clinical intensity</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h3 style="color: var(--primary-teal); margin-bottom: 15px;">Who Benefits from PHP?</h3>
<p style="font-size: 17px; line-height: 1.8; margin-bottom: 20px;">
                    Partial hospitalization is ideal for:
                </p>
<ul style="font-size: 17px; line-height: 2; padding-left: 25px; margin-bottom: 30px;">
<li>Patients transitioning from <a href="residential-treatment.html">residential treatment</a> or <a href="medical-detox.html">detox</a></li>
<li>Those who need intensive care but have a stable living environment</li>
<li>People with co-occurring mental health conditions requiring daily monitoring</li>
<li>Individuals who've relapsed after outpatient treatment</li>
<li>Anyone needing structure and support but unable to commit to 24/7 residential care</li>
