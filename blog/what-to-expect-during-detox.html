<article style="padding: 4rem 0;">
<div class="container" style="max-width: 800px; margin: 0 auto;">
<p style="font-size: 1.2rem; line-height: 1.8; margin-bottom: 2rem;">The decision to enter <a href="../services/medical-detox.html">medical detox</a> is one of the most courageous choices you'll ever make. It's also one that comes with a lot of questions—and often, a lot of fear. What will it be like? Will it hurt? What happens when I get there?</p>
<p>At Trust SoCal's Orange County detox facility, we understand these concerns. We've helped thousands of people through the detox process, and we want you to know exactly what to expect. Knowledge reduces fear, and fear is one of the biggest barriers to getting help.</p>
<p>This guide walks you through the entire <strong>medical detox process</strong>—from the moment you arrive to the day you transition to the next phase of treatment.</p>
<!-- Day 1 -->
<h2 style="margin-top: 3rem; color: #2E8B8B;">Day 1: Arrival and Assessment</h2>
<h3>What Happens When You Arrive</h3>
<p>When you arrive at our detox facility in Orange County, you'll be greeted by our admissions team. We know you might be feeling anxious, scared, or even sick from withdrawal—and we're prepared for that. Our goal is to make you comfortable as quickly as possible.</p>
<p><strong>The first few hours include:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Intake paperwork:</strong> Basic information, insurance verification, and consent forms</li>
<li><strong>Medical assessment:</strong> A nurse and doctor will evaluate your physical condition, including vital signs, current withdrawal symptoms, and medical history</li>
<li><strong>Psychological assessment:</strong> We'll screen for co-occurring mental health conditions like anxiety, depression, or trauma</li>
<li><strong>Drug screening:</strong> To confirm what substances are in your system and at what levels</li>
<li><strong>Room assignment:</strong> You'll be shown to your private or semi-private room</li>
</ul>
<div style="background: #e8f5f5; padding: 1.5rem; border-radius: 10px; margin: 1.5rem 0; border-left: 4px solid #2E8B8B;">
<strong style="color: #2E8B8B;">What to Bring:</strong> Comfortable clothing, toiletries, phone numbers of loved ones (phones may be limited), any prescription medications in original bottles, and ID/insurance cards. We provide most necessities, so pack light.
                </div>
<h3>Your First Medications</h3>
<p>Once we understand what you're withdrawing from, our medical team will create a personalized medication protocol. This isn't about getting you high—it's about keeping you safe and comfortable. Medications may include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>For alcohol withdrawal:</strong> Benzodiazepines to prevent seizures, vitamins (especially thiamine)</li>
<li><strong>For opioid withdrawal:</strong> Suboxone, methadone, or comfort medications for specific symptoms</li>
<li><strong>For all patients:</strong> Anti-nausea medication, sleep aids, anti-anxiety medication, and pain relief as needed</li>
</ul>
<!-- Days 2-4 -->
<h2 style="margin-top: 3rem; color: #2E8B8B;">Days 2-4: Acute Withdrawal Phase</h2>
<p>This is typically the most challenging part of detox, but it's also when our medical support is most intensive. You won't be going through this alone.</p>
<h3>What Acute Withdrawal Feels Like</h3>
<p>Withdrawal symptoms vary by substance, but common experiences include:</p>
<table style="width: 100%; border-collapse: collapse; margin: 1.5rem 0;">

<h3>How We Keep You Comfortable</h3>
<p>Our medical staff monitors you around the clock during this phase. We use evidence-based protocols to manage symptoms:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Regular vital sign checks:</strong> Every 2-4 hours, or more frequently if needed</li>
<li><strong>Medication adjustments:</strong> We'll increase or change medications based on your symptoms</li>
<li><strong>Hydration and nutrition:</strong> IV fluids if you can't keep food down, plus easy-to-digest meals</li>
<li><strong>Comfort measures:</strong> Cool compresses, heating pads, comfortable bedding, quiet environment</li>
<li><strong>Emotional support:</strong> Our staff is trained in compassionate care—we've seen it all and don't judge</li>
</ul>
<div style="background: #fff3cd; padding: 1.5rem; border-radius: 10px; margin: 1.5rem 0; border-left: 4px solid #ffc107;">
<strong style="color: #856404;">Important:</strong> The acute phase is temporary. Most people start feeling significantly better by day 3-4. We know it's hard, but you're safer here than anywhere else, and relief is coming.
                </div>
<!-- Days 5-7 -->
<h2 style="margin-top: 3rem; color: #2E8B8B;">Days 5-7: Stabilization Phase</h2>
<p>By day 5, most patients turn a corner. The worst is behind you, and you'll start to feel more like yourself again.</p>
<h3>Physical Improvements</h3>
<p>During stabilization, you'll likely notice:</p>
<ul>
<li>Improved sleep quality</li>
<li>Returning appetite</li>
<li>More stable mood</li>
<li>Increased energy (though still recovering)</li>
<li>Reduced cravings (still present, but manageable)</li>
</ul>
<h3>What You'll Be Doing</h3>
<p>As you stabilize, we'll introduce some light activities:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Group meetings:</strong> Introduction to 12-step or SMART Recovery concepts</li>
<li><strong>One-on-one counseling:</strong> Beginning to process emotions and create a treatment plan</li>
<li><strong>Nutritious meals:</strong> Helping your body heal with proper nutrition</li>
<li><strong>Light exercise:</strong> Short walks, stretching, yoga if you're up for it</li>
<li><strong>Treatment planning:</strong> Working with your clinical team on next steps</li>
</ul>
<!-- After Detox -->
<h2 style="margin-top: 3rem; color: #2E8B8B;">After Detox: What Comes Next</h2>
<p><strong>Detox is essential, but it's only the first step.</strong> Your brain and body have been changed by addiction, and it takes time and treatment to heal. Detox gets the substances out of your system—but ongoing treatment addresses why you used in the first place.</p>
<h3>Next Steps After Detox</h3>
<p>Based on your individual needs, our clinical team will recommend one of the following:</p>
<div style="display: grid; grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(250px, 1fr)); gap: 1.5rem; margin: 2rem 0;">
<div style="background: #f8f9fa; padding: 1.5rem; border-radius: 10px; border-top: 4px solid #2E8B8B;">
<h4 style="color: #2E8B8B; margin-top: 0;"><a href="../services/residential-treatment.html">Residential Treatment</a></h4>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0;">30-90 days of 24/7 care. Best for those with severe addiction, unstable home environments, or co-occurring mental health disorders.</p>
</div>
<div style="background: #f8f9fa; padding: 1.5rem; border-radius: 10px; border-top: 4px solid #2E8B8B;">
<h4 style="color: #2E8B8B; margin-top: 0;"><a href="../services/php.html">Partial Hospitalization (PHP)</a></h4>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0;">5-6 hours/day, 5-7 days/week. Live at home or sober living while receiving intensive treatment during the day.</p>
</div>
<div style="background: #f8f9fa; padding: 1.5rem; border-radius: 10px; border-top: 4px solid #2E8B8B;">
<h4 style="color: #2E8B8B; margin-top: 0;"><a href="../services/iop.html">Intensive Outpatient (IOP)</a></h4>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0;">3-4 hours/day, 3-5 days/week. More flexibility for those with work or family obligations, but still structured support.</p>
</div>
</div>
<!-- Why Medical Detox -->
<h2 style="margin-top: 3rem; color: #2E8B8B;">Why Choose Medical Detox in Orange County</h2>
<p>You might be wondering if you really need medical detox—or if you can just quit on your own. Here's why professional detox matters:</p>
<h3>Safety First</h3>
<p>Withdrawal from alcohol and benzodiazepines can cause <strong>life-threatening seizures</strong>. Opioid withdrawal, while rarely fatal, can lead to dangerous dehydration from vomiting and diarrhea. Medical detox provides 24/7 monitoring and immediate intervention if complications arise.</p>
<h3>Comfort and Success</h3>
<p>Most people who try to quit on their own relapse within the first few days—because withdrawal is so uncomfortable. Medical detox uses medications to ease symptoms, making it far more likely you'll complete the process and move into treatment.</p>
<h3>Seamless Transition to Treatment</h3>
<p>At Trust SoCal, detox is integrated with our treatment programs. You won't be discharged to figure things out on your own—you'll transition directly into the next level of care with the same clinical team.</p>
